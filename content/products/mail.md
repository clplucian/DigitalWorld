### Mobile
Our mail servers support *IMAP push* and *SMTP*. THis allows connection to your mobile phone and desktop clients. Push will notify you in real time as new mail arrives. SMTP allows you to send mail from any device.

### Filtering
Our server have spam and antivirus filters. The spam filter is based on a state of the art self-learning algorithm. Whenever a user moves a message to spam, the spam filter will update its definitions to do its job better the next time. Both the spam and antivirus receive daily definitions with the latest threads. Those definitions are update by huge community around the world, so that we learn quickly about new threads. Spam filtering intensity can be managed per user.
